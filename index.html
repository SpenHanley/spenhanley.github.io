						This is a two part project, one part is the server that is installed on a computer (linux, windows or mac) which communicates with the second part of this project which is an android app that can be downloaded for free from the play store. I created this as I wanted some default settings to be applied on my phone when I get home. For instance I want my phone to switch to vibrate and disable bluetooth so that I don't remain connected to my bluetooth headset and drain the battery on it. It also forwards all of the alerts on my phone to my pc so that I don't have to check my phone every few minutes. All settings can be customised through the web interface, this is done so that the server can be installed on anything that has a web connection and doesn't require the user to access the machine that it is installed on to be able to modify the settings.

						As the name suggests it is yet another project that was started to give me something to do. It is based around a toy turtle that was brought into my primary school when I was younger to teach us about robots and programming.
